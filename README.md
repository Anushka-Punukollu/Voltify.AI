# Voltify.AI ðŸ”‹

To create a sustainable future, our energy production must shift away from fossil fuels and towards integrating renewables. But something is stopping this transitionâ€¦

Our energy grid is broken. Itâ€™s made for old power generation, and the current grid can't handle the variability of renewable energy sources with overworked grids and operators. To understand the depth of this problem, I analyzed research papers, studied documentaries, and conversed with experts in the field to gain a first-hand understanding of the complex grid drawbacks. Through a root-cause analysis of renewables and the energy grid, I identified two critical gaps in the systemâ€”rigidity and an inability to handle variability.

From this, Voltify.AI emerged, integrating AI models to forecast renewables for seamless grid integration. Leveraging weather forecasts allows for the prediction of renewable energy output. It includes real-time monitoring of demand versus energy supply, aiding operators in identifying gaps in the system before blackouts arise. Enabling operators to anticipate fluctuations and optimize energy distribution reduces inefficiencies, restores balance, and makes renewables the answer - not the problem. The ultimate goal of Voltify.AI is to create an adaptable grid that accommodates the ebb and flow of renewable energy demands. This is currently the V1 release and more parts are being added - if you are interested in gaining access to the energy output prediction model reach out :)
